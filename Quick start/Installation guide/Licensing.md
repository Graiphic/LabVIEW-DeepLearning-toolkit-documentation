# 🔑 Licensing SOTA

Our licensing system provides access to the entire toolkit suite included in **SOTA**.  
As part of this suite, activating your license allows you to **unlock all functionalities** of the **LabVIEW Deep Learning Toolkit**.

## 🧩 License Activation Methods

We offer **two methods** to activate your SOTA license:

1. **Certificate generation** — involves an email-based file exchange procedure.  
2. **Token-based activation** — involves entering a license token provided by our team.

When you install **SOTA** for the first time, a **30-day trial license** is automatically activated on your machine.

🎓 **Students:**  
We provide free academic licenses.  
To request one, please contact us at [licence@graiphic.io](mailto:licence@graiphic.io) and include a copy of your student ID.
