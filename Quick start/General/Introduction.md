# 🧠 Introduction

![Deep Learning Toolkit](deeplearning.svg)

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Toolkit** documentation base.

Here you will find all the instructions you need to **install, configure, and understand** the toolkit.  
The documentation is divided into two main sections: **GENERAL** and **API**.

---

## 🌍 Overview

The **LabVIEW Deep Learning Toolkit** is the **world’s first framework built on ONNX and ONNX Runtime**.

- **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** — an open standard format that enables the description and exchange of AI models across tools and platforms in an interoperable way.  
- **ONNX Runtime** — the official execution engine, optimized to deploy these models efficiently across a wide range of hardware and environments.

## 🧪 Validation Environment

Our validation of functional operators was performed with the following versions:

- **ONNX:** 1.18.0  
- **ONNX Runtime:** 1.23.0 + cu125

To explore the list of supported functional operators, visit:  
👉 [**Graiphic ONNX Runtime – Execution Providers Tester**](https://github.com/Graiphic/ONNX-Runtime/tree/main/Execution%20Providers%20Tester)  
and open the **`ops20`** folder.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This section provides general information about the toolkit and how to get started.  
It is divided into two sub-sections to guide you step by step through installation and first use.
